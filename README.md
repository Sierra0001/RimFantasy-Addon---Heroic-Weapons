# RimFantasy Addon - Heroic Weapons

An addon weapon pack featuring weapons drawn by number of talented artists from the RimWorld Discord.

Works similarly to RimFantasy - Arcane Weapons, except each heroic weapon are more expensive to craft and only has one fixed special ability.

### Features

- 6 Arcane weapons (1 unique weapon trait each)
- 2 Researches

### Balance

Gems are intentionally sparse and not easy to obtain through natural means, but they can also be purchased from traders or obtained from salvaging certain objects.

Balance feedbacks are welcomed, please provide context when doing so.

### Compatibility

- Save Game Compatible
- Will not play nice with other gemstone mods without a patch.
